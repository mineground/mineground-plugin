----------
+ **/notes** *[player]*

  Displays a list with the ten most recent notes written to *player*'s profile.

This command is accessible from in-game and the console.

This command is aliased as **/why**, because players familiar with [Las Venturas Playground](http://sa-mp.nl/) may be used to that.

This command is implemented in the [AdministratorCommands](../../src/main/java/com/mineground/features/AdministratorCommands.java) feature.
