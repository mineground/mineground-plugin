----------
+ **/staff**

  Displays all online staff members grouped together by their level. Management members will be shown first, then administrators, then moderators.

This command is aliased as **/admins**, because players familiar with [Las Venturas Playground](http://sa-mp.nl/) may be used to that.

This command is implemented as a [general command](../../src/main/java/com/mineground/features/GeneralCommands.java).
