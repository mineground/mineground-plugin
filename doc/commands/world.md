Mineground command: /world
==========

Gives administrators the ability to list, create, remove and manage the worlds available on Mineground. Various advanced settings may be changed as well, although these may require the management permission.

[Â« back to command overview](../commands.md)

----------
+ **/world classic** *[name]**

  Displays or sets the classic world on Mineground. This is where the [/classic](classic.md) command will teleport to.

+ **/world create** *[type=amplified/biomes/flat/normal]* *[environment=end, nether, normal]* *[name]*

  Creates a new world on Mineground. This is a very powerful command which is only available to Management members. The available arguments are as follows:

  + **type**
    One of *amplified* (higher, more volatile), *biomes* (biomes will be 16 times bigger), *flat* (completely flat world) or *normal*.
  + **environment**
    One of *end* (end world), *nether* ("hell", as described by Minecraft) or *normal*.
  + **name**
    The name of this world.

  The world will be created synchronously, thus **all** other work on the server will stop. An announcement will be distributed to all players about the expected lag.

+ **/world creative** *[name]**

  Displays or sets the creative world on Mineground. This is where the [/creative](creative.md) command will teleport to.

+ **/world destroy** *[world]* **CONFIRMED**

  Removes the World *world* from Mineground. The word *CONFIRMED* must follow the world's name to make this command awkward to use. Once removed, it will not be possible to bring back the world or its contents.

+ **/world list**

  Displays a list of which worlds are available on the Mineground server.

+ **/world set animals** *[limit=15]*

  Sets the maximum amount of animals which may spawn in any chunk in the current world. The limit needs to be between 0 (disables animals altogether) and 150, with the default value being 15.

+ **/world set difficulty** *[difficulty=peaceful, easy, normal, hard]*

  Sets the difficulty of the current world. In a peaceful world, the server will not spawn mobs, the food bar will not deplete and health will automatically regenerate. In an easy world, hostile mobs will spawn, but will do significantly less damage. The food bar will deplete, but will keep a minimum of five hearts. In a normal world, hostile mobs spawn and incur normal damage. The food bar will deplete, but will keep a minimum of half a heart. In a hard world, hostile mobs spawn and incur increased damage. The food bar depletes and can kill the player completely. Zombies will break through wooden doors, and spiders can spawn with potion effects.

+ **/world set mobs** *[limit=50]*

  Sets the maximum amount of mobs which will spawn in any chunk in the current world. The limit needs to be between 0 (disables mob spawning altogether) and 150, with the default value being 50.

+ **/world set pvp** *[enabled=allowed, disallowed, default]*

  Sets whether PVP (player-versus-player) should be enabled for the current world. The value *allowed* means that any player can attack any player, regardless of their own preferences. *disallowed* means that no one will be able to kill no one, whereas *default* means it may be enabled depending on the player's own settings.

+ **/world set readonly** *[value=true, false]*

  Changes whether the current world should be read-only. When enabled, no player, including Management members and server operators, will be able to make changes to the blocks.

+ **/world set rule** *[rule]* *[value=true, false]*

  Enables or disables advanced, name-based settings. These are Minecraft's *game rules*, and may change between releases. The following rules are available:

  * **block-drops**: Whether breaking a block should drop items.
  * **command-block-notify**: Notify online operators when a player uses a command block.
  * **daylight-cycle**: Whether the day and night cycles should be enabled. When disabled, it basically locks the sun.
  * **fire-spread**: Whether fire can spread from one block to another.
  * **health-regeneration**: Whether a player's health should be naturally regenerated.
  * **keep-inventory**: Whether players should keep their inventory after dying.
  * **mobs-damage**: Whether mobs can do damage to blocks.
  * **mobs-loot**: Whether mobs should drop items when they're killed.
  * **mobs-spawn**: Whether mobs should be spawned in this world at all.

  Again, please do mind that any of these commands may stop working in future releases of Minecraft.

+ **/world set spawn** *here*

  Sets the spawn position of the current world. The player will always be looking towards the south when spawning.

+ **/world survival** *[name]**

  Displays or sets the survival world on Mineground. This is where the [/survival](survival.md) command will teleport to.

+ **/world warp** *[world]*

  Warps you to the spawn position of *world*.
