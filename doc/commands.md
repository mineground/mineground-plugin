Mineground commands
==========

There is a wide variety of commands available on Mineground, each of which adds to the player's in-game experience. Sometimes a command requires a player to be at least a certain level, for example for administrative features, but we intent to make as much functionality available to all players as is reasonable.

The following table should list all of the supported commands on Mineground. If you notice that the documentation of a command is outdated, or perhaps that a command is missing altogether, please either [file a bug](https://github.com/mineground/mineground-plugin/issues/new) or send a pull request to fix it yourself.
