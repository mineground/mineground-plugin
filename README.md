Las Venturas Mineground (mineground-plugin)
=================
[Las Venturas Mineground](http://mineground.com/), also known as Mineground, is a community based around Minecraft. This plugin will be the primary tool in creating a unique, stable and fully featured server to play on.

We develop the plugin with the following principles in mind:
  * **Enjoyable**. Each feature must contribute to creating a more complete, enjoyable environment on the server. This can be done through either player-visible features enhanving their experience, or through administrative features allowing them to be of better help.
  * **Unique**. Mineground, as a community, should differentiate itself from other Minecraft servers by offering a unique, consistent in-game experience for players. Deriving from existing Minecraft ideas is an option.
  * **Performant**. Minecraft isn't exactly known because of it's great performance, and by embracing asynchronous programming paradigms we hope to keep the server as responsive as possible.
  * **Reliable**. Nothing is more annoying than commands and features which have persistent bugs, or fail to function completely at times. A broad set of tests will cover the plugin's code.

Together, we hope to be able to significantly improve the in-game experience for our players!
